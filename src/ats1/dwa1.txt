this file is entirely created for the purpose of 
documeting mainly the functions that i believe will 
going to be reused to make other games. 


//DialogBox.js:
this is literally the fucking code for dialog box i copied from smwhere, idk idc gfurself. 
//one change this needs is ive to make it un skippable initially. once the player has completed the game, he/she will then get the option to fast click and go through all the messages.
