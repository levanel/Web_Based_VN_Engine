# Story Flow System

## Planned Features (Future Updates)
The following features are **not yet implemented** but are planned for future updates:

### 1. Story Flow and States
- The story will be structured into a flow-based system made up of **states**.
- **Major States:** Represent significant story events such as:
  - Introduction of a new character.
  - A change in location or a scene transition.
  - Emotional shifts or critical narrative events.
- **Minor States:** Represent smaller events, such as individual dialogues or messages within the story.

### 2. State Transitions
- Transitions between states will occur for significant changes in the narrative, such as:
  - Character introductions.
  - Movement to a new location.
  - Key emotional or plot-driven events.

### 3. Chapter Board
- The story flow will be organized into a **chapter board**.
- Each chapter will contain its own flow of states, keeping the story structured and modular.

### 4. Drag-and-Drop Interface
- A **drag-and-drop** interface will allow users to intuitively add and organize major states in the story.

> These features are designed to enhance the usability and flexibility of the system, making it easier for creators to design complex narratives in a visual and straightforward manner.
